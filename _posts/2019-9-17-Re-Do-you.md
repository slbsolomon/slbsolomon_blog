title: RE: Do you finish everything you start?
---

I stopped reading books because I could never stop reading them; I always had to finish what I started. This "skill" can be really helpful at times, like for completing a homework, or going the full distance to make a delicious meal without cutting any corners. But sometimes I just can't complete the task at hand. For whatever reasons, sometimes it's just not possible. When you have an all or nothing brain like myself, not being able to finish something can be really hard on your self esteem. As a result, Iâ€™ve been having to learn how to put books down. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from one another. 

All the best,
